## neighborListGenerate.py 
The algorithm in neighborListGenerate.py lists out all the neighbors of each channel according to the radius specified. 

## Make sense visually
To visually see how the neighbors are listed, the figure here might be useful. The red color indicate a channel and the yellow channels are the neighbors.
