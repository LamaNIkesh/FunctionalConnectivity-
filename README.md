## Connectivity estimation attempt

Attempt to created a connectivity map using the synchrony levels measured from the ISI and SPIKE-distance metrics. So, synchrony levels for all one-one connections are stored into a dictionary as a key value pair where key is the channel number and the value is the synchrony level. Then these keys are taken as nodes and values as edges that connects the nodes.
